My personal journey while learning php, html, xampp, and how to navigate and work on VS Code

A friend is teaching me how to code through VS Code. It's a big step but I look forward to the day when I can look back and see all my mistakes.
I understand growth is slow at first, but coming into this field with no knowledge or experience, I'm anticipating where I will end up.

So far we have touched on and worked on php, bootstrap, html, xampp (myphpadmin), and a few other topics.
  It can be overwhelming at first but soon I feel like this first repository will be a memory I can look back on and admire how far I have come.
